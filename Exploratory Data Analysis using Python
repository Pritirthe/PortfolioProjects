This notebook contains exploratory data analysis using Python, showcasing various techniques and visualizations.
This project aims to analyze Instagram data to understand the reach and engagement of posts, and to build a machine-learning model to predict the reach of future posts. 
The data includes metrics such as impressions, likes, comments, shares, saves, profile visits, and follows for various Instagram posts. Through exploratory data analysis
and visualization, we uncover insights about the sources of impressions and the effectiveness of different types of content.

Summary and Achievements
Purpose: This project helps content creators understand the factors influencing their Instagram reach and engagement. By analyzing historical data, creators can optimize their content strategy.
Key Findings: The major sources of impressions are from followers and hashtags. Likes significantly boost reach, while comments have little effect. The explore section contributes minimally to overall reach.
Model Utility: The reach prediction model provides a practical tool for estimating the potential reach of future posts, allowing creators to make data-driven decisions.
Benefit: Content creators and social media marketers can use these insights to improve their Instagram strategy, enhance engagement, and predict the performance of their posts.

Insights and Findings
Data Summary
Dataset: Contains 119 entries with 13 columns, including impressions from various sources, engagement metrics, captions, and hashtags.
Null Values: No null values are present in the dataset.
Impressions Analysis
Distribution of Impressions From Home:

The impressions from the home section indicate how well the posts reach followers. The distribution shows that reaching all followers daily is challenging.
Visualization: Distribution plot of impressions from the home section.
Distribution of Impressions From Hashtags:

Hashtags are used to categorize posts and reach a broader audience. The distribution shows that while hashtags can reach new users, not all posts benefit equally.

Distribution of Impressions From Explore:

The explore section functions as Instagram's recommendation system. The impressions from explore are relatively low, suggesting that Instagram does not frequently recommend the posts.

Percentage of Impressions From Various Sources:

A donut plot shows that approximately 50% of impressions come from followers (home), 38.1% from hashtags, 9.14% from explore, and 3.01% from other sources.

Relationship Analysis
Likes and Impressions:

A linear relationship between likes and impressions suggests that more likes generally lead to higher reach.

Comments and Impressions:

The number of comments does not significantly impact the reach of posts.
Visualization: Scatter plot with a trendline showing the relationship between comments and impressions.
Shares and Impressions:

More shares correlate with higher reach, but the effect is not as strong as likes.
Visualization: Scatter plot with a trendline showing the relationship between shares and impressions.
Saves and Impressions:

Saves positively impact reach, but the effect is moderate compared to likes.
Visualization: Scatter plot with a trendline showing the relationship between saves and impressions.
Conversion Rate
Conversion Rate: The conversion rate is calculated as (Follows/Profile Visits) * 100, resulting in a 41% conversion rate, which is considered high.
Visualization: Scatter plot with a trendline showing the relationship between profile visits and followers gained.
Reach Prediction Model
Model Training:

A PassiveAggressiveRegressor model is trained to predict the reach of posts based on engagement metrics such as likes, saves, comments, shares, profile visits, and follows.
Model Score: The model achieves a score of 0.609 on the test set.
Reach Prediction:

The model can predict the reach of a post given its engagement metrics. For example, given 282 likes, 233 saves, 4 comments, 9 shares, 165 profile visits, and 54 follows, the predicted reach is approximately 8554 impressions.
